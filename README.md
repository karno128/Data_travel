**IMPLEMENTATION OF K-MEANS CLUSTERING 
ALGORITHM TO DETERMINE PRIORITY 
AREAS FOR POVERTY ALLEVIATION
 IN EAST JAVA**

Poverty is a serious issue requiring attention both at the national and global levels. In Indonesia, a similar increase has occurred since September 2022, with a rise of 0.03% and a total of 26.36 million people declared impoverished. East Java is one of the provinces with the highest poverty rates in Indonesia. To aid in a more structured resolution of the issue, there is a need to control and reduce poverty cases by determining priority areas for intervention. This study utilizes data from 2021 to 2023. The algorithm applied is the K-Means algorithm using the KDD methodology, which includes data selection, data preprocessing, transformation, data mining, and interpretation/evaluation. Two clusters were formed, with 19 areas identified as low priority and 19 areas as high priority. The clustering resulted in a silhouette coefficient of 0.60, indicating a good structure silhouette coefficient 0.55.
